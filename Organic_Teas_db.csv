I should've known better. The marketing got the best of me, with the ""super antioxidant"" label. The convenient ""proprietary"" blend doesn't reveal how much licorice root is in it, but it's apparently enough to elevate my otherwise normal cortisol level. I've had my cortisol levels measured for years as part of a slew of tests. It's always been normal, until I started drinking this tea. The elevated cortisol on my labs matched how I felt--strung out with no good lifestyle reason--but it took me a week to put my finger on what was caused it. I stopped the tea, went back to plain green tea. My last two cortisol readings have been in the normal range again. Truth is--herbs are drugs, and should be used with caution. If you know that you've got elevated cortisol, this green tea herbal blend with licorice root might be great for you. I'm giving one star for not listing amounts of what are herbal DRUGS. One doesn't know if the amount of  a listed herb is negligible or substantial, until feeling the negative impact, and seeing the proof in the labs. I'm not buying anything Yogi.

The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Kombucha tea is also great which has a berry taste, that is good and natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas.

First, they wanted to give me a green tea with caffeine, and I had to politely refuse, as me and caffeine are no longer on good terms. And they offered me the tea that smelled the best, tasted the best: Candy Cane Lane, they called it. Assured that it was decaf, and that I was safe among tea-bearing bears (yes, bears), I made myself at home with cup after cup of their decaf tea. Alas, when it was time for me to return to my own fast-paced world, I could not find the tea‚ÄîI searched everywhere for the tea! Tops and bottoms of tea shelves‚Äîand nothing, nothing, nothing! No Candy Cane Lane! Finding it again proved tricky, aside from going straight to the source (the Celestial Seasonings website), and still trying to pay the right price for it.
